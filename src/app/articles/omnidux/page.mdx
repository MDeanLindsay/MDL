Omni Dux, meaning "guide to all", also a not-so-sublte nod to the University of Oregon, 
was started with the sole ambition of helping small businesses thrive. We are firm 
believers that everything in life was made by those no smarter than you or I. You can 
change it, you can influence it, and you can build things that people use to make real 
impact. You are the core to your business, and nothing will change that, but sometimes 
everyone can use a helping hand.
