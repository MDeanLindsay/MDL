                                    | As you will read below, this project came to be because I was annoyed that I couldn't find any reliable sources to a fairly innocuous question: Who has died the most in film?

                                    | This lead to dipping my toes in parsing wikimedia exports, which as anyone who has cleaned years of manual entry data has learned, is a bit of a nightmare. 
                                    | At the moment, the dataset is just three columns: Name, Movie, Year Released. I aim to use NLP libraries to append a cause of death, and then join in other categorical imdb data in the near future to create an uncessarily comprehensive dashboard.
                                    | If something is worth doing it's worth doing well, right?
